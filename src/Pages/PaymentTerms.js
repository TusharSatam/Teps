        other charges. After we have given you notice that we did not receive an
        on-time, full payment from you, we may suspend or cancel the Services if you do
        not make the full payment within the relevant time. Suspension or cancellation
        of the Services for non-payment could result in a loss of access to and use of
        your account and its content. Depending on your location, some transactions
        might require foreign currency conversion or be processed in another country.
        Your bank might charge you additional fees for those services when you use a
        debit or credit card. Please contact your bank for details.</span></p>
